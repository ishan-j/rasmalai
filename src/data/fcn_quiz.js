But we need only 32. So we can use fewer borrowed bits. Let's find mask: host bits=10, so network bits=22. That's /22. Subnets = 2^(22-8)=16384. That's overkill but works. Options: /18, /20, /19, /17. /19 leaves 13 host bits (8190 hosts), and subnets=2^(19-8)=2048. /18 leaves 14 host bits (16382 hosts), subnets=8192. /20 leaves 12 host bits (4094 hosts), subnets=4096. /17 leaves 15 host bits (32766 hosts), subnets=512. None gives exactly 32 subnets, but /17 gives 512 subnets, /18 gives 8192. The requirement is 32 subnets, so /17 gives 512 (more than 32), /18 gives 8192. /19 gives 2048. All exceed 32. Possibly they want the smallest mask that meets both: hosts≥1000, subnets≥32. /17: hosts=32766 OK, subnets=512 OK. /18: hosts=16382 OK, subnets=8192 OK. /19: hosts=8190 OK, subnets=2048 OK. /20: hosts=4094 OK, subnets=4096 OK.
